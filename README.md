### Future Features

- Optional headline filtering via terminal
    - The user could add optional filters of criteria for the news API to use, including which country the program sources headlines from, or the number of results.
- Add further word bank entries
    - Users could add additional key words they think are relevant over time to impending doom, to refine the game further, especially if some words become more common over time due to media trends.
- Analytics and interpretation
    - At the end of each week, users might receive insights on their average point scores over time, represented in fun and visual ways with google charts or graphics.
- Add sound effects when results are printed
    - At the end of each game, a sound is played to add additional user feedback for improved UX. This was not possible at the current time of deployment due to issues with static file handling in Heroku.

## Data Model

### Flowchart

To follow best practice, a flowchart was created for the app's logic,
and mapped out before coding began using
[Freeform](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2022/12/apple-launches-freeform-a-powerful-new-app-designed-for-creative-collaboration/).

Below is the flowchart of the main process of this Python program. It shows the entire cycle of the program.

![screenshot](documentation/flowchart.png)

### Classes & Functions

<!-- The program uses classes as a blueprint for the project's objects (OOP). This allows for the object to be reusable.

```python
class Person:
    """ Insert docstring comments here """
    def __init__(self, name, age, health, inventory):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.health = health
        self.inventory = inventory
``` -->

The primary functions used on this application are: 
<!-- UPDATE THIS FURTHER -->

- `get_headlines()`
    <!-- - Get sales figures input from the user. -->
- `process_data()`
    <!-- - Converts all string values into integers. -->
- `remove_common_words()`
    <!-- - Update the relevant worksheet with the data provided. -->
- `percentage_of_wordbank_matches()`
    <!-- - Compare sales with stock and calculate the surplus for each item type. -->
- `get_wordbank_matches_list()`
    <!-- - Collects columns of data from sales worksheet.
- `get_user_input()`
    <!-- -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%. -->
- `update_worksheet_cell()`
    <!-- -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%. -->
- `update_worksheet_row()`
    <!-- -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%. -->
- `calculate_user_buzzword_points()`
    <!-- -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%. -->
- `calculate_user_percentage_score()`
    <!-- -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%. -->
- `play_again()`
    <!-- -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%. -->
- `main()`
    - Run all program functions.

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Code Institute has provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser.
This is to improve the accessibility of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://zombie-bingo-a26c47d43c24.herokuapp.com).

<!-- CHECK THIS LINK ABOVE WORKS -->

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- If using any confidential credentials, such as CREDS.JSON, then these should be pasted in the Config Variables as well.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select **Add Buildpack**.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

If using any confidential credentials, such as `CREDS.json` or `env.py` data, these will need to be manually added to your own newly created project as well.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RaymondBrien/zombie-bingo) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/RaymondBrien/zombie-bingo.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/RaymondBrien/zombie-bingo)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RaymondBrien/zombie-bingo)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
